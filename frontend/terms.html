                    Promotions such as contests or sweepstakes available through the Service may have rules that differ
                    from these Terms & Conditions. If you participate in a Promotion, please review its specific rules
                    along with our Privacy Policy. If there is a conflict between the Promotion rules and these Terms &
                    Conditions, the Promotion rules will take precedence.

                    you provide is accurate, complete, and up-to-date. Providing false, incomplete, or outdated

                    You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password, as well as for
                    restricting access to your computer and account. Any activity that occurs under your account and

                    **Governing Law**

                    rights. If any part of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining
                    provisions will still be in effect. These Terms represent the entire agreement between us concerning
                    the Service, superseding any prior agreements related to it.

                    **Changes**

                    We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or update these Terms at any time. If
                    significant changes are made, we will provide at least 30 days' notice before the new terms take
                    effect. What constitutes a "material change" will be determined solely by us.

                    By continuing to use or access our Service after any updates to the Terms, you agree to be bound by
                    the revised terms. If you do not agree to the updated terms, you must discontinue using the Service.
